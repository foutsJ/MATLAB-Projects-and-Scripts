These scripts were written primarily to double-check answers. As a result, there are several minor errors or formatting issues
that were deemed unimportant for the sake of practicality. Upon feedback, GOALS will update, but there remain a few:

GOALS:
- Fix formatting to be consistent
- Account for errors accounted for in the Issues tab
- Ultimately: Combine all into a single mini-suite program that can perform any cplx number operation

Revised code will eventually be placed into its own branch
