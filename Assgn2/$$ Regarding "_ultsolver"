This file is the goal of creating a suite for all complex number operations in its infancy.

It's very crude, but can get basic jobs done between two complex numbers (or it can find a single compliment).

Plans for expansion:
- Theoretically compute any number of complex numbers
- incorporate more vectorization to store complex numbers entered
- Fix inconsistent formatting
- Write GUI?
